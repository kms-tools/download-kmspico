The program supports many versions of Windows, including Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11, as well as Office starting from version 2010 and up to the most current version 2021. KMSpico has gained particular popularity in emerging economies such as Brazil and India, where high software prices often become a barrier. In these countries, students, office workers and freelancers choose KMSpico as an affordable solution for performing professional tasks without additional license costs.
